# JoesFlow

The goal of JoesFlow is to analyze high-dimensional single cell data
from flow cytometry, scRNA-seq, CITE-seq and any kind of single cell
matrix data. JoesFlow utilizes novel scRNA-seq dimension reduction
techniques to generate interpretable and informative visualizations that
incorporate all aspects of a dataset in an unbiased manner.
